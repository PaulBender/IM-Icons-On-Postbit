Adds instant messaging icons to the postbit. The icons can be clicked on to bring up a pop-up containing the IM contact of that user (ICQ's opens a link to that user's ICQ.com profile and Google Hangouts just links to that person's profile).

Icons will only display if the field in question is filled in and the user has permission to view profiles.

This plugin offers full language support.

The 'oldrelease' branch contains the 1.6 version of the plugin.
